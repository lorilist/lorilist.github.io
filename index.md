# Hi there!

I'm a creative problem solver, passionate about helping people live healthier lives. I work as a **Lead Data Scientist at 84.51°**, supporting Kroger Health. In this role, I partner with business leads, healthcare providers, and software developers to build pharmacy and nutrition solutions. 

Project highlights:
* **OptUP Sciences** - Lead development of sciences supporting Kroger's healthy shopping app, OptUP, including product nutrition rating science, better-for-you recommendation science, and household scoring science. 
* **Clinical Intervention Workflow** - Scope, build, and monitor intervention programs designed to drive clinical outcomes such as patient drug adherence, vaccine series completion, and diabetes prevention.
* **Custom Insights** - Support data-driven decision making through causal inference analysis, patient profiling, and ad-hoc descriptive statistics.

When I'm not telling stories with data, I enjoy exploring Cincinnati's many parks, trying out new recipes at home, and obsessing over my dog, Otto.
